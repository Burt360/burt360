## CAD (computer-aided design)
What do you get when you combine **3D modeling** with **math and programming**? Onshape's *FeatureScript*.<br>
Check out these projects I coded:
- [Icosahedron](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/21fe442c6fdbdcc9cb2b762c/w/619a021ea6ad2afa637303f4/e/aff030f8e2b8273743bfc213)
- [Customizable 3D-printable name plaque](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/08b419c7da1909c559eabade/w/1ad50dfb376ded4ce8ed581e/e/6325e3273e6240fbe1433c1f) (to create your own plaque, create a free account and copy the document, then simply enter your name)
