# About me
I'm a senior studying **applied math** and completing a concentration in data science and machine learning.

# Projects

## ACME (Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis)
This is the full name of my major along with its handy acronym. It's a blend of **math**, **computer science**, and **statistics**, with the goal of understanding, designing, and implementing optimization algorithms and machine learning.

On my profile you'll find my repository named "ACME." It contains my work on coding labs and will be updated with additional work from time to time.

## CAD (computer-aided design)
What do you get when you combine **3D modeling** with **math and programming**? Onshape's *FeatureScript*.<br>
Check out these projects I coded:
- [Icosahedron](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/21fe442c6fdbdcc9cb2b762c/w/619a021ea6ad2afa637303f4/e/aff030f8e2b8273743bfc213)
- [Customizable 3D-printable name plaque](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/08b419c7da1909c559eabade/w/1ad50dfb376ded4ce8ed581e/e/6325e3273e6240fbe1433c1f) (to create your own plaque, create a free account and copy the document, then simply enter your name)
